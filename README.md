# My Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! 
Following, the Top 3 of my projects:

- [Project 1: AI Risk Prediction and Treatment Effect Estimation](https://github.com/JuanRugerio/AI_Risk_Prediction_And_Treatment_Effect_Estimation) - Decision Tree and LSTM implementations to predict spinal surgery revision.
- [Project 2: Graph Coloring Problem](https://github.com/JuanRugerio/Graph_Coloring_Problem) - SEQ, RLF and Simulated Annealing implementations in C to solve the Graph Coloring Problem.
- [Project 3: Shortest Path Graph](https://github.com/JuanRugerio/Shortest_Path_Graph) - This system calculates and displays the shortest path between two points on a map using different methods.
